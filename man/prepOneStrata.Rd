\title{This function takes data as a dataframe with one row per observation and prepares it for one strata for MCpbt}
\usage{
prepOneStrata(
  trapData,
  tags,
  GSIcol,
  PBTcol,
  variableCols = c(),
  variableColsOth = c(),
  adFinCol,
  AI = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  GSIgroups = NA,
  variableValues = NA,
  variableValuesOth = NA,
  strataName = NA,
  symPrior = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{trapData}{dataframe with data for fish sampled from one strata - trap data for dam escapement}

\item{tags}{dataframe with tag rates for all groups. This should NOT include the Unassigned group.}

\item{GSIcol}{name of column containing GSI assignments. If you have no GSI information, create a column with
the same value for all samples.}

\item{PBTcol}{name of column containing PBT assignments}

\item{variableCols}{vector of column names of columns containing the variables to estimate composition and 
to inform the group selection for PBT untagged fish}

\item{variableColsOth}{vector of column names of columns containing the variables to estimate composition but 
NOT inform the group selection for PBT untagged fish}

\item{adFinCol}{name of column containing adipose fin status - TRUE (or AI) being intact FALSE (or AD) being clipped, NA missing}

\item{AI}{TRUE to analyse ad-intact fish, FALSE to analyze ad-clipped fish}

\item{verbose}{TRUE to print some messages, FALSE to not}

\item{GSIgroups}{These are the values for all the GSI groups that you expect to be present in the population. If NA, then
the values are taken to be all the unique values in the GSI column in the dataset.}

\item{variableValues}{a list, in the order of \code{variableCols} with entries having the values expected for each variable. This
is helpful to make sure the same variable values are estiamted in each strata even if one value is not observed in all strata. If
a value other than a list is given (for example, NA), it uses the values present in the dataset.}

\item{variableValuesOth}{Same as variableValues, but for variableColsOth}

\item{symPrior}{All the priors are Dirichlet distributions. The default is to use this value for all the alphas of all
the priors. You can, and are encouraged to, manually adjust the priors as you see fit prior to running the MCMC chain.}

\description{
This function is called by \code{prepStrata}. This function may be of use to you in writing your own wrapper,
or performing a specific analysis, but generally users should use \code{prepStrata} to prepare their data for
\code{estimStrataMCpbt}.
